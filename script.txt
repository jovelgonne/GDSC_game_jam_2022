I'd like to thank you all for agreeing to join this project.
For the next few weeks we'll finally be executing our initiative.
With the power of business and government connections.

The world is full of job instability and financial insecurities. 
The distribution of wealth and power continues to skew. 
Governments worry more about the welfare of their businesses rather than that of their people..

And as such, I believe we have the solution.
The PEP Social Score System!
Enforcing youths around the world, to serve a minimum of a thousand PEP hours yearly!

This will revolutionise society!
Together we will work to enforce my grand plan to stop the crisis of international unemployment.
I hope you all do your part as a member of The Universal Society of Youth Discipline, or USYD for short.

It seems Tony notices me amongst the crowd.

Ah, you there! 
I believe I remember you having skills related to data collection, I need to speak to you about something.

What is your name?
> Anton
> Nee
Wow how exotic!
Wow what a unique name!

I can tell there is something special about you.
And I think I remember something along the lines of you being a talented surveyor?
As such, I was wondering if you could accompany me tomorrow?

Will you accompany me?
> Sure! You can count on me like one two three!
> I'm only going with you because it's my job. 
Tony: Thanks! I really appreciate it. I'll contact you later to talk to you more about it.
Tony: Ahâ€¦ okay. That's fine with me I guess.

Looks like it's time for lunch break. I'll catch you later I suppose!
