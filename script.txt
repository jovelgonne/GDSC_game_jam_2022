I enter the workplace to find my boss, Tony Cadi, speaking to the entire room.
It seems the grand project he's been so excited about is finally getting revealed.
I sure hope it's a beneficial program to society with no ridiculous caveats.

I'd like to thank you all for agreeing to join this project.
For the next few weeks we'll finally be executing our initiative.
With the power of business and government connections.

The world is full of job instability and financial insecurities. 
The distribution of wealth and power continues to skew. 
Governments worry more about the welfare of their businesses rather than that of their people..

And as such, I believe we have the solution.
The PEP Social Score System!
Enforcing youths around the world, to serve a minimum of a thousand PEP hours yearly!

This will revolutionise society!
Together we will work to enforce my grand plan to stop the crisis of international unemployment.
I hope you all do your part as a member of The Universal Society of Youth Discipline, or USYD for short.

It seems Tony notices me amongst the crowd.

Ah, you there! 
I believe I remember you having skills related to data collection, I need to speak to you about something.

What is your name?
> Anton
> Nee
Wow how exotic!
Wow what a unique name!

I can tell there is something special about you.
I remember something along the lines of you being a talented business and data consultant?
As such, I was wondering if you could accompany me tomorrow?

Will you accompany me?
> Sure! You can count on me like one two three!
> I'm only going with you because it's my job. 
Thanks! I really appreciate it. I'll talk to you later to talk to you more about it.
Ah.. okay. That's fine with me I guess.

Looks like it's time for lunch break. I'll catch you later I suppose!

In the cafeteria, my peer and close friend, Sonia Online, joins me.
In the distance, I can see Tony holding a coffee and looking through paperwork.

Heyo, what's hip and happening broski?
That speech Tony made back there was pretty weird huh?
I'm not sure I'm a fan of this PEP system idea..


> It's pretty insane..
> I guess it's kinda reasonable.
I know right! Surely there won't be enough people to support such an idea.
Ahaha, funny joke! Anyways, I'm sure he won't be able to find enough people to agree anyway.

Speaking of which..
Say.. what do you think of that sight over there?

Sonia seems to gesture towards Tony, who's still drinking his coffee.
And also seriously looking at that paperwork, very, very aggressively. 


> He does look.. kinda handsome.
> Why the hell is he sitting here in the staff cafeteria and not his fancy office?
True. Some oddballs just look oddly good I guess.
Ahahaha, I'm sure there's some out there who'd want him to sit on them instead. Weirdos.

Wait… no way! It seems he's coming this way.

Hello! I wanted to talk to you about the details of the meetup tomorrow! 
We're meeting with a very important business associate.
I need you there to handle the data exchange between our businesses.

Huh? What do you need my friend for then? Aren't you just wasting their time?
They could be doing more important work.
You sure you're not some weirdo trying to spend private time with my friend here?

I swear I'm a completely normal guy!
Your friend's one of our core developers for our data system!
I also need them to meet my associate so they can discuss more things.

Hmm… seems reasonable enough I suppose.

I do wish people were a bit more trusting of my plan. 
I know you may not agree with it, but I truly do believe it's the best course of action.
I mean, surely your friend here thinks I'm normal right?

> You're a bit odd, but it's not necessarily bad.
> You're quite eccentric.. one of the furthest people away from normal.
Ah, I see.. well, at least it's not bad I guess. See you tomorrow I suppose.
Oh. I see, I understand.. Well, see you tomorrow I guess.

Tony leaves, a bit down-trodden.

I guess you have to do your job and go with him after all.
Who knows, maybe you'll be able to make him realise his plan's whack too.

Be careful though, I think he seems kinda crazy.
He called himself completely normal earlier, but look at how he is.
Those who think of themselves as normal are often the furthest away from it.

Watch out for yourself okay?
> Well, I do like a little crazy.
> Yeah, I get creepy vibes from him. Looks like I'll have to be careful.
What!? You really are a whackjob. Whatever, call me in case anything happens okay?
Yep. Be sure to call me in case anything happens okay?

After a scrumptious hearty meal, I head home for the day.
I get prepared and think about how I'd convince Tony to stop his PEP Program.
Once the day's started, I get ready and head to the cafe to meet Tony.

I arrive at the cafe to find Tony sitting by himself.
It seems his associate has yet to arrive.

Hi! Glad you could make it!
My associate hasn't arrived yet, but when he does you'll have to talk to him about some things.

I know there's some people who may not necessarily agree with my plans.. 
But I really am just trying to make the world a better place for everyone.
I really believe this program, as strict as it may be, will be good for the world.

When I graduated from university, I'd spent too much of my time focusing only on my studies.
I didn't do any other extracurricular activities, and because of that, I failed to land a job for years.
On the edge of starvation and financial ruin, the associate we're meeting today hired me.

He's a mentor and former boss of mine whom I really respect.
He let me do all kinds of responsibilities in his company, and I thought it was important.
Even when the jobs weren't all that relevant, any experience is experience right?

Anyway, that's enough about me.
While we're sitting here waiting, why don't we try an ice-breaker of sorts?
Like.. jokes! Let's try that.

I'm a huge fan of puns, and it'd be great if you could try one on me.
Go ahead, any joke that comes to your mind!

What's a pun you'd like to say?
> Are you a Happy Meal? Because I'm McLovin you!
> Are you Monday Morning? Because nobody likes you.
What a weird thing to say all of the sudden.. you're lucky I'm receptive to jokes.
That's pretty rude y'know, you're lucky I'm receptive to jokes.

A man enters the cafe in a suit. It appears to be Tony's associate.

Hello! Tony! My old friend! I haven't seen you in so long!
And this here must be the developer you mentioned?

Yes yes, it's great to see you! Please please, take a seat!
My peer here is one of our key developers and I believe you need to discuss with them.

Ah, how embarrassing..
It seems I have to go to the restroom for a bit.
Entertain our associate here please, I'll be back shortly.

Tony leaves to go to the restroom. You and Winnie sit for a few awkward minutes before he starts talking.

You know, this guy spent months begging me to fund his project.
He's very determined to make this all happen.
You've gotta give credit where credit's due.

Huh.. I guess Tony really is dedicated to making a change.

Shame he doesn't realise my true intentions.
He's neglected the full ramifications of me funding this project.
And that is.. advertising rights.

While Winnie is talking, Tony arrives back behind him.

The advertisements that'll run all across all the PEP Sites will grant me so much money.

I couldn't care less about 

Excuse me!?

Ah! Tony! I didn't realise you were back! You shoulda said something!

And you should've kept your mouth shut.
Regardless of how much funding you provide, I can't work with you if that's your plan.
I can't believe you'd do this to me.

Wait! Everything I said was a joke just now! I swear I-

Clearly limiting the PEP Program to Youths is not enough..
Even seniors like you clearly need more humility and people experience.
I'll make it so that everyone has to undertake the PEP program.

That's ridiculous! You can't pull something like that!
You're just being naive. You know if it wasn't for me you'd be nothing.
If I didn't take you under my wing I'd-

Tony is visibly furious. He's about to swing a punch before you take matters into your own hands.

You grab Winnie the Pooh's hand and arm-wrestle it down so hard he drops dead.

..

Thanks.. I'd probably have done worse if you hadn't stepped in before I did.
But.. I see now there's something I have to do.
I'm submitting this proposal straight to the company head and enacting it out now.

I thought working with my old boss's company would make things smoother.
But I don't need his help. Clearly this is something I need to do on my own.
I'm changing the plan to include everyone, youths or not, and increasing the ours.

Tony storms out of the cafe, leaving you behind with Winnie's unconscious body. 
You too, quickly leave the cafe, running out into the now raining outdoors.
