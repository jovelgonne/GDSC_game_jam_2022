The world is full of job instability and financial insecurities. 
The distribution of wealth and power continues to skew. 
Governments worry more about the welfare of their businesses rather than that of their people...

I hope you all do your part as a member of The Universal Society of Youth Discipline, or USYD for short. 
Together we will work to enforce my grand plan to stop the crisis of international unemployment:

The PEP Social Score! 
Enforcing people around the world, especially our Youths, to serve a minimum of a thousand PEP hours a year! 

This will revolutionise society!

Ah, you there! What is your name? 
I believe I remember you having skills related to data collection, I need to speak to you about something.

What is your name?
